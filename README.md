# Codepath-Security-Week-9

#Honeypot 1
The use of honeypots can be a good way to analyze/identify an attack.  Honeypots can prevent threats towards the user as well.  This weeks 
assignment required us to set up a honeypot by creating a server and the honeypot.  The server was used to detect various types of attacks
identifying the country and port the attack came from.  Using nmap allowed us to test and see the honeypot in action, such that we used nmap
to attack the honeypot.  Upon last checking the number of attacks the MHN server received was 8,527 attacks to our honeypot.  The 
dionea honeypot is designed to catch malware that exploits vulnerabilities.  

In order to attack the honeypot the following command was used:

> nmap 104.155.179.143

GIF Walkthrough:
Here is a gif showing the result of total attacks at the time this screen capture was taken along with the attack performed using nmap.
